            <p>With cyberattacks around the world escalating rapidly, insurance companies are ramping up the requirements to qualify for a cyber insurance policy. Ransomware attacks were up 80% last year, prompting underwriters to put in place a number of new provisions designed to prevent ransomware and stem the record number of claims. Among these are a mandate to enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) across all admin access in a network environment as well as protect all privileged accounts, specifically machine-to-machine connections known as service accounts</p>
            <p>But identifying MFA and privileged account protection gaps within an environment can be extremely challenging for organizations, as there is no utility among the most commonly used security and identity products that can actually provide this visibility.</p>

                <span class="text">The problem is that defining administrative access is easier said than done. How do you compile an accurate list of every admin user? While some can be easily identified – for example, IT and helpdesk staff – what about so-called shadow admins?</span>

                <span class="text">These include former employees that may have left without deleting their admin accounts, which then continue to exist in the environment along with their privileged access. As well, there are also users with admin access privileges who may not have been officially assigned as admins, or in some cases temporary admins whose accounts weren't deleted after the reason for their creation was complete.</span>

            <p>The first-ever Linux variant of the Clop ransomware has been detected in the wild, but with a faulty encryption algorithm that has made it possible to reverse engineer the process.
            "The ELF executable contains a flawed encryption algorithm making it possible to decrypt locked files without paying the ransom," SentinelOne researcher Antonis Terefos said in a report shared with The Hacker News.
          The cybersecurity firm, which has made available a decryptor, said it observed the ELF version on December 26, 2022, while also noting its similarities to the Windows flavor when it comes using the same encryption method.
        The detected sample is said to be part of a larger attack targeting educational institutions in Colombia, including La Salle University, around the same time. The university was added to the criminal group's leak site in early January 2023, per FalconFeedsio.

            <p>A new attack campaign has been targeting the gaming and gambling sectors since at least September 2022, just as the ICE London 2023 gaming industry trade fair event is scheduled to kick off next week.
            Israeli cybersecurity company Security Joes is tracking the activity cluster under the name Ice Breaker, stating the intrusions employ clever social engineering tactics to deploy a JavaScript backdoor.
          The attack sequence proceeds as follows: The threat actor poses as a customer while initiating a conversation with a support agent of a gaming company under the pretext of having account registration issues. The adversary then urges the individual on the other end to open a screenshot image hosted on Dropbox.
        Security Joes said that the threat actor is "well-aware of the fact that the customer service is human-operated."
      Clicking the purported screenshot link sent in the chat leads to the retrieval of an LNK payload or, alternatively, a VBScript file as a backup option, the former of which is configured to download and run an MSI package containing a Node.js implant.</p>

            <p>Organizations in East Asia are being targeted by a likely Chinese-speaking actor dubbed DragonSpark while employing uncommon tactics to go past security layers.
            "The attacks are characterized by the use of the little known open source SparkRAT and malware that attempts to evade detection through Golang source code interpretation," SentinelOne said in an analysis published today.
          A striking aspect of the intrusions is the consistent use of SparkRAT to conduct a variety of activities, including stealing information, obtaining control of an infected host, or running additional PowerShell instructions.
        The threat actor's end goals remain unknown as yet, although espionage or cybercrime is likely to be the motive. DragonSpark's ties to China stem from the use of the China Chopper web shell to deploy malware – a widely used attack pathway among Chinese threat actors
      The command-and-control (C2) servers, on the other hand, are situated in Hong Kong and the U.S., the cybersecurity firm said.</p>
